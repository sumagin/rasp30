bm_my_D_latch1.v
	- Incomplete sensitivity list in combination process. Causes ModelSim to ignore a reset signal. 

bm_DL_D_latch.v                 
	Regarding: 
	 always @(D or Clk)
		if (Clk)
			Q = D;	
	- Odin fills in an "else" condition where Q = 0. ModelSim fills in no "else" condition and Q is initially set to x (unknown).
